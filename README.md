# Asteroid Game

A small Python project I built using **Pygame** to reacquaint myself with **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. It’s a simple take on the classic *Asteroids* arcade game — you control a ship that can rotate, move, and avoid or destroy incoming asteroids.

## 🎮 Features
- Smooth ship rotation and movement  
- Basic collision detection between the ship, bullets, and asteroids  
- Clear object-oriented design (`Player`, `Asteroid`, `Bullet`, etc.)  
- Modular code for easy extension and experimentation  

## 🧠 Purpose
This project was mainly a refresher on OOP fundamentals in Python — focusing on how classes interact within a real-time game loop and how to structure small, event-driven systems cleanly.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):  
   ```bash
   uv pip install pygame
   ```
2. Run the game:  
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

## 🎥 Demo
A short gameplay video is included as **`asteroid_demo.mov`** — it shows the ship controls, asteroid movement, and basic collision behavior.  
[🎥 Watch the demo](./asteroid_demo.mov)

## 🧩 Future Ideas
- Add scoring, lives, and levels   
- Add sound effects and smoother animations
